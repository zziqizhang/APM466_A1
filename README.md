I collected all historical close prices for 32 Canadian Government Bonds from the “Frankfurt” Exchange for ten business days. As all bonds pay coupons semi-annually, I chose ten to perform the task. In that calculations by hand are time-consuming and that I would have to repeat solving similar equations many times, I decided to utilize Python to follow the algorithms. For yield rates, I looped through yields starting at 0.05 to find approximate solutions as Python does not have built-in functions to solve equations. For spot rates, I followed the bootstrapping method in as much as the equations are all simple ones that Python can easily manage. Later, I also taught myself Principle Component Analysis to study log-returns. In the end, the report was typed in LaTeX with an explanation of algorithms and an analysis of curves, winning acknowledgment from the professor and classmates.
